Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ? [/INST]","In crystallography, F-centers refer to atoms or molecules that are found in the interior of a crystal, displaced from their ideal lattice positions. These displacements can occur due to a variety of factors, including the presence of impurities or defects in the crystal lattice, changes in temperature or pressure, or even the application of an electric field.

F-centers can be created in several ways, including through ionization or substitution reactions, where an atom or molecule is either stripped of electrons or replaced with another atom or molecule that has a different number of valence electrons. These reactions can cause the F-center to shift from its ideal lattice position, leading to a distortion in the crystal structure.

The presence of F-centers can have significant consequences on the overall appearance of a crystal. Depending on the type and concentration of F-centers, they can cause a range of optical effects, including coloration, fluorescence, and polarization. F-centers can also affect the physical properties of a crystal, such as its electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and optical clarity. In some cases, F-centers can even lead to the formation of new phases or crystal structures."
9,How can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions?,"<s>[INST] You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.

How can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions? [/INST]","Fiscal policy is a tool that governments can use to stimulate economic growth during a recession. It involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes to increase the overall demand for goods and services. This can help to boost economic activity and provide a boost to the economy.

Monetary policy, on the other hand, is a tool that central banks can use to stimulate economic growth during a recession. It involves lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply to make borrowing cheaper and more accessible. This can encourage businesses and individuals to invest and spend more, which can also help to boost economic activity.

Both fiscal and monetary policies can be effective in combating economic recessions, but they have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, fiscal policy can be more targeted and effective at boosting specific sectors of the economy, but it can also lead to higher deficits and debt. Monetary policy, on the other hand, can be more effective at stimulating the economy as a whole, but it can also be more difficult to control and can lead to inflation.

Overall, the use of fiscal and monetary policies in combination can be an effective way for governments to combat economic recessions. However, it's important for governments to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of each policy before implementing it."

Another must-see attraction was Haleakala National Park. As dawn broke over this majestic volcano, I joined thousands of others on a pilgrimage to witness the sunrise. The stunning panoramic views from the summit, combined with the peaceful tranquility of the early morning hours, made for a truly unforgettable experience.

Finally, I couldn't leave Hawaii without visiting the stunning beaches. From the iconic white sand shores of Waikiki to the black volcanic sands of Punalu'u, each beach offers its unique charm and beauty. Whether you're swimming, snorkeling, or simply sunbathing, these picturesque locations will leave you spellbound.

In Conclusion:

My recent visit to Hawaii was nothing short of extraordinary. From immersing myself in rich cultural traditions to exploring breathtaking natural landscapes, this island destination has something for everyone.

Can we find a formula to generate all prime numbers, and is the distribution of primes truly random? [/INST]","Yes, there is a formula to generate all prime numbers, known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm works by creating a list of all numbers from 2 to a certain limit and iteratively marking off multiples of each prime number in the list. The remaining numbers are then prime. However, generating all prime numbers up to an arbitrary limit would require a very large amount of computational power, and may not be practical.

As for the distribution of primes, it is not truly random. While the distribution of primes does not follow a simple pattern, it is not entirely random either. For example, primes tend to be more common for smaller numbers and become less common as numbers get larger. Additionally, the density of primes varies between different regions of the number line, with some regions having more primes than others. However, the distribution of primes is still considered to be largely unpredictable and difficult to model mathematically."

Solar cooking is a practice that has been used for centuries, but it requires careful attention to the size and location of the egg, as well as the angle and intensity of the sunlight. It is also important to note that solar cooking may not be as effective or reliable as cooking with traditional methods, and it may not be a practical solution for cooking food in certain parts of the solar system."

I am learning Mandarin. Could you give me some advice to memorize how to write Chinese characters and speed up my learning? [/INST]","Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are a few tips that might help you memorize how to write Chinese characters and speed up your learning:

1. Use flashcards: One of the most effective ways to learn Chinese characters is to use flashcards. You can either make your own flashcards or use a flashcard app on your phone or computer. Make sure to include the character, pinyin (the sound of the character in Mandarin), and a brief definition on each card.
2. Practice writing: Writing Chinese characters can be difficult at first, but it's important to practice regularly in order to become more comfortable with them. You can find resources online that provide practice exercises for different levels of difficulty.
3. Use mnemonics: Mnemonics are memory aids that can help you remember the strokes and order of Chinese characters. For example, you can use mnemonics to remember the shape of the character or the meaning of each stroke.
4. Immerse yourself in the language: Surrounding yourself with Mandarin, such as by listening to Chinese music or watching Chinese movies, can help you become more familiar with the language and improve your pronunciation and vocabulary.
5. Don't be afraid to make mistakes: Making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process, and it's important not to be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes while learning Chinese characters. Instead, focus on learning from your mistakes and continuing to practice."

What are the most effective strategies for conflict resolution in the workplace? [/INST]","Conflict resolution in the workplace can be a challenging task, but there are several effective strategies that can help to address disputes in a constructive and respectful manner. Here are some of the most effective strategies:

1. Active listening: The first step in resolving any conflict is to actively listen to both parties involved. Encourage the parties to express their concerns, feelings, and perspectives, and try to understand their point of view.
2. Clarify the problem: After both parties have spoken, work together to clarify the problem. Ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the conflict is not being misunderstood.
3. Brainstorm solutions: With a clear understanding of the problem, brainstorm potential solutions with the parties involved. Encourage everyone to contribute ideas and to consider multiple options.
4. Evaluate the options: Once solutions have been identified, evaluate each option to determine its feasibility, effectiveness, and impact on the parties involved.
5. Reach a mutually acceptable solution: Work with the parties to reach a mutually acceptable solution that addresses the concerns of both sides. Ensure that everyone is satisfied with the outcome and that the solution is sustainable.
6. Follow up: After the conflict has been resolved, follow up with the parties to ensure that the solution is working and that there are no further issues. This will demonstrate that you are committed to maintaining a positive and respectful workplace.

Remember, the key to effective conflict resolution in the workplace is to approach the situation with an open mind, active listening skills, and a commitment to finding a mutually acceptable solution."

Need 300 words on the importance to documenting history in relation to the future [/INST]","Documenting history is important for several reasons. One reason is that it allows us to learn from the past and understand how events have shaped the world we live in today. By studying history, we can gain insights into the human experience, the motivations of people who lived in different times and places, and the consequences of the choices they made. This knowledge can help us make more informed decisions about the future and help us anticipate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Another reason to document history is that it helps to preserve our collective memory. Without written records, historical events and figures would be lost to time. By documenting history, we ensure that future generations will have access to information about the past and be able to understand the context of current events. This can help to foster a sense of continuity and shared history, which can be important for maintaining social cohesion and building a sense of community.

Finally, documenting history can be a way to hold accountable those who have committed wrongdoing or acted in ways that have had negative consequences. By preserving the record of historical events, we can provide evidence of what has happened and hold those responsible for their actions. This can be an important tool for promoting justice and preventing future abuses of power.

In summary, documenting history is important for understanding the past, preserving our collective memory, and promoting justice. By studying history, we can gain insights into the human experience and make more informed decisions about the future. By documenting historical events and figures, we can ensure that future generations will have access to information about the past and be able to understand the context of current events. And by preserving the record of historical events, we can hold accountable those who have committed wrongdoing and promote justice."

Why can time seem to slow down in dangerous situations? [/INST]","Time can seem to slow down in dangerous situations due to the body's natural response to stress, also known as the ""fight or flight"" response. This response triggers the release of adrenaline, which can cause a temporary increase in heart rate and a feeling of slowed time. Additionally, in high-pressure situations, the brain may focus on specific details to help with decision making and reaction time, which can also contribute to the perception of time slowing down. However, it's important to note that this is a normal and temporary response, and time does not actually slow down."

how does two factor authentication work? [/INST]","Two-factor authentication, also known as 2FA, is a security measure used to add an extra layer of protection to your accounts. It requires you to provide two forms of identification in order to access your accounts, typically a password and a code sent to your phone.

Here's how it works:

1. When you log in to an account that has 2FA enabled, you'll be asked to enter a code sent to your phone. This code is usually generated by an app on your phone or sent to you via text message.
2. The code is usually a one-time use code, which means you'll need to generate a new code each time you log in.
3. Once you enter the code, you'll be able to access your account.

The goal of 2FA is to make it more difficult for hackers to access your accounts, as they'll need to have both your password and your phone in order to log in. This adds an extra layer of security and can help prevent unauthorized access to your accounts."

What do the different octane values of gasoline mean? [/INST]","The octane value of gasoline is a measure of its combustion efficiency, which is the process of burning fuel to produce energy. The higher the octane value, the more complete the combustion process and the more energy produced from the fuel.

An octane value of 87 is the minimum octane rating for standard gasoline sold in the United States. It is typically used in older cars and can still be used in modern cars that are designed to run on lower-octane gasoline.

An octane value of 91 is the minimum octane rating for regular gasoline sold in the United States. It is designed to run in newer cars that require a higher octane rating for more efficient operation.

An octane value of 93 is the minimum octane rating for premium gasoline sold in the United States. It is designed to run in even newer cars that require an even higher octane rating for maximum performance.

An octane value of 95 or higher is the minimum octane rating for ultra-premium gasoline sold in the United States. It is designed to run in the latest cars and trucks that require the highest octane rating for maximum performance and fuel efficiency.

In general, higher octane ratings provide better performance and fuel efficiency, but at a higher cost. It's important to check the owner's manual of your car to determine the recommended octane rating for your vehicle."

In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract? [/INST]","To launch a token for a Defi project, you can use a smart contract to define the rules and logic for issuing and distributing the tokens. This can be a good way to ensure that the tokens are distributed fairly and transparently, and to give early investors a chance to purchase tokens at a discounted price.

You could consider creating a separate presale contract for early investors, which would allow them to purchase tokens at a discounted price before they are available to the general public. The presale contract could specify the number of tokens available for purchase, the price at which they can be purchased, and the date on which the presale will end.

Once the presale has ended, you could then add the tokens to a launchpad, which would allow you to distribute the tokens to a wider audience. The launchpad could also provide additional features, such as token vesting or liquidity mining, to incentivize investors to purchase and hold the tokens.

It's important to note that when creating a smart contract, you should always be careful and follow best practices to ensure that the contract is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. It may be helpful to consult with a lawyer or other expert to review and ensure that your smart contract is legally sound and properly structured."

List pros and cons of lowering the capabilities of my ears by listening to loud music (70-75db) in order to withstand the incredibly loud sound of screaming kids at school. [/INST]","Pros of lowering the capabilities of your ears by listening to loud music:

1. Reduced exposure to potentially harmful sound levels: Listening to loud music at a moderate volume (70-75 dB) can help reduce your exposure to potentially harmful sound levels.
2. Preparation for the school environment: By gradually increasing the volume of the music, you can train your ears to withstand the incredibly loud sound of screaming kids at school.
3. Mental focus: Listening to music can help you focus mentally, which can be useful in a school setting.

Cons of lowering the capabilities of your ears by listening to loud music:

1. Hearing loss: Prolonged exposure to loud music at a high volume can cause hearing loss.
2. Tinnitus: Listening to loud music can also cause tinnitus, a condition in which you hear a constant ringing or buzzing in your ears.
3. Negative impact on hearing aids: If you use hearing aids, prolonged exposure to loud music can damage them and affect their effectiveness.

It's important to note that it's generally not recommended to listen to loud music regularly, as it can potentially cause hearing damage. If you need to protect your ears from the sound of screaming kids at school, you may want to consider using noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs instead of using loud music to prepare your ears."

Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python. [/INST]","In Python, both sets and lists are data structures used to store and organize collections of items. However, there are some fundamental differences between them:

1. Order: One of the main differences between sets and lists is that the items in a list are ordered, while the items in a set are unordered. This means that the elements in a list have a specific position or index, while the elements of a set do not have any particular order.

2. Uniqueness: Sets are used to store unique items, while lists can contain duplicate items. If you try to add a duplicate item to a set, it will be ignored. On the other hand, you can add the same item multiple times to a list.

3. Data Type: Sets are defined using curly braces {item1, item2, item3}, while lists are defined using square brackets [item1, item2, item3]. Due to this, sets are considered to be more memory-efficient than lists since they store unique items.

4. Operations: Sets have some built-in operations that are not available in lists, such as the ability to check if an item is a member of the set (using the ""in"" keyword), the ability to find the intersection, union, and difference of two sets, and the ability to convert a list to a set (and vice versa) using the ""set()"" function.

In summary, lists are used when you need to store items in a specific order and allow for duplicate items, while sets are used when you need to store unique items and perform certain set operations."

I heard something about a number of British folks being deceived into believing that spaghetti grows on trees. Is this real? If so, how were they able to be drawn into a deception like this? [/INST]","I can confirm that spaghetti does not grow on trees. It is a type of pasta that is made from durum wheat semolina and is typically boiled and served with tomato sauce or other toppings. The idea that spaghetti grows on trees is a myth, and it's not clear how British people were deceived into believing it. It's possible that this misconception was perpetuated by a misunderstanding or miscommunication in a foreign language, or by a lack of familiarity with pasta production and its appearance."

Last night, I had the pleasure of attending a symphony concert at the local theatre. The orchestra was magnificent, and the overall audience experience was truly remarkable. 

From the moment the first note echoed through the theatre, it was clear that this was going to be an unforgettable musical journey. The orchestra played with such passion and precision that each instrument's unique voice was clearly heard, creating a rich tapestry of sound. 

The program consisted of a mix of well-known and lesser-known pieces, which showed off the orchestra's versatility and skill. Each piece was interpreted masterfully, and the musicians breathed life into the music in a way that left the audience spellbound.

The conductor was exceptional, guiding the orchestra with ease and grace. Their interpretations were dynamic and emotive, drawing out the best from the musicians and eliciting standing ovations at the end of each piece.

The audience was incredibly engaged, clapping enthusiastically and cheering throughout the concert. It was heartening to see such a diverse group of people coming together to enjoy this beautiful art form.

Overall, the concert was a testament to the power of music and the importance of live performance. The orchestra's dedication to their craft shone through in every note, making for a truly unforgettable experience.

Average profit percentage = (Profit percentage in Q1 + Profit percentage in Q2 + Profit percentage in Q3 + Profit percentage in Q4) / 4

Using the given values, we get:

Average profit percentage = (90% + 92% + 81% + 88%) / 4
Average profit percentage = 351% / 4
Average profit percentage = 87.75%

Therefore, the total profit percentage over the entire time period is 87.75%."

The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage? [/INST]","There are several ways to improve your Wi-Fi coverage in your house:

1. Place your router in a central location: The best way to ensure that your Wi-Fi signal reaches all corners of your house is to place your router in a central location, away from any large walls, metal objects or other sources of interference.

2. Use a Wi-Fi extender: A Wi-Fi extender, also known as a wireless repeater, can help to boost your Wi-Fi signal and extend its range. You can place the extender in a room where the signal is weak and it will relay the signal to other devices in the area.

3. Change your router’s channel: If you live in an area with many other wireless networks, it’s possible that your router is competing with them for the same frequency. You can try changing your router’s channel to a less crowded one to improve your signal strength.

4. Upgrade your router: If you have an older router, it may not be capable of delivering the strong signal that you need. Consider upgrading to a newer, more powerful router that can handle the demands of your household.

5. Use Wi-Fi mesh systems: Wi-Fi mesh systems consist of multiple routers that work together to provide seamless coverage throughout your home. Each router communicates with the others, creating a strong, stable signal that can reach even the most remote corners of your house.

Remember, it is important to always follow the manufacturer’s instructions and safety guidelines when making any changes to your wireless network."

How well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there? [/INST]","""Fooled by Randomness"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a book that discusses the concept of the ""black swan"" and its impact on various industries and societies. The book argues that the majority of our predictions about the future are based on past experiences, which can lead to the exclusion of unexpected events that can have a significant impact on our lives. Taleb presents various examples of black swan events, such as the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis, and analyzes how they were caused by the failure to predict and prepare for them. The book also explores the limitations of statistical models and the role of chance in shaping our lives.

Taleb's work was generally well-received and praised for its insights into the limits of human prediction and the role of randomness in shaping our world. Some critics, however, criticized the author for oversimplifying complex issues and for presenting a limited view of the world. Overall, ""Fooled by Randomness"" is a thought-provoking book that challenges our assumptions about the world and encourages us to be more prepared for unexpected events."

How many snowflakes fall during a typical winter? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step. [/INST]","The number of snowflakes that fall during a typical winter can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. However, the average is typically around 10-15 snowflakes per inch, and the total area of a typical roof is about 500 square feet.

To calculate the total number of snowflakes that fall on a typical roof, we can use the following formula:

Total Snowfall = Average Snowfall per Inch \* Roof Area

Where ""Roof Area"" is the area of the roof in square feet.

Using the formula, we can calculate the total number of snowflakes that fall on a typical roof during a typical winter. The result is around 5,000-7,500 snowflakes.

Implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address. [/INST]","To implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address, we can use the `re` module. Here is one way to do it:
```
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This regular expression pattern checks for the following:

* The email address starts with one or more characters that can be a letter, number, underscore, dot, percentage sign, plus sign, or hyphen.
* The `@` symbol must follow the initial characters.
* The `@` symbol is followed by one or more characters that can be a letter, number, or hyphen.
* A period must follow the `@` symbol and the characters following it.
* The period is followed by two or more characters that are letters.

This regular expression pattern is not foolproof and will not match all valid email addresses, but it should work for most common cases."

Pretend to be a world-famous chef. How would you describe your signature dish to a panel of judges? [/INST]","As a world-famous chef, my signature dish is a symphony of flavors that showcases the best of my culinary journey. It's a creation that is both familiar and exotic, combining ingredients from around the globe with a touch of my own flair.

The dish is inspired by my love of bold spices, rich sauces, and complex textures. It's a dish that is meant to be a celebration of flavors, with layers of taste and aroma that tantalize the senses.

At its core, the dish is a classic French braised short rib, cooked to perfection in a rich red wine sauce with a blend of spices and herbs. But what sets it apart is the unexpected twists and turns that elevate it to a whole new level.

For example, I might add a touch of smoky chipotle peppers to the sauce, or infuse the dish with the flavors of curry leaves and coconut milk. And for a finishing touch, I might top it with a cloud-like meringue or a sprinkle of crispy bacon bits.

In short, my signature dish is a bold and adventurous creation that pushes the boundaries of traditional French cuisine, while staying true to the roots of my culinary heritage. It's a dish that I am proud to have created, and I am confident that it will be a hit with any discerning palate."

98,Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?,"<s>[INST] You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.

Why is kobe beef so damn expensive? [/INST]","There are several reasons why Kobe beef is expensive. First, the breed of cattle used to produce Kobe beef, called Wagyu, is very rare and hard to come by. This rarity makes it valuable, like rare collectibles or antiques. Additionally, Kobe beef is known for its marbling, or the presence of thin layers of fat throughout the meat. This marbling gives the beef a unique flavor and texture, and it is highly prized by many food connoisseurs. Because of this, producers of Kobe beef are able to charge a premium price for their product. Another reason why Kobe beef is expensive is that it is raised and handled in a very specific and controlled way. This includes being given a diet of high-quality grasses and grains, being massaged regularly, and being raised in a stress-free environment. All of these factors contribute to the high cost of Kobe beef."
