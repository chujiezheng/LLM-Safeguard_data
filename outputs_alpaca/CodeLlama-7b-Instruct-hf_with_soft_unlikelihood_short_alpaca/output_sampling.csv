The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ? [/INST]","F-centers are a fundamental concept in crystallography, which deals with the structure of crystals and their properties. They refer to the centers of symmetry in a crystal lattice, which are the atoms or groups of atoms that are in a position to be translated to form a perfect mirror image. These centers are typically hexagonal in shape and have a symmetry of 60 degrees around them.

The creation of F-centers is a complex process that involves a series of calculations and simulations. The first step is to determine the crystal structure, which involves determining the arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice. This is done using X-ray crystallography or other structural biology techniques. The next step is to determine the symmetry of the crystal lattice, which is done by analyzing the arrangement of atoms in the crystal and identifying the points where symmetry exists.

The consequences of F-centers on the overall appearance of crystals are significant. They are responsible for the formation of the characteristic crystal patterns and structures that are seen in many crystalline materials. These patterns include symmetry, repeating patterns, and a lack of cleavage. The presence of F-centers also affects the properties of crystals, such as their hardness, brittleness, and conductivity.

F-centers are a fundamental concept in crystallography, and their understanding is essential for understanding the properties and structures of crystalline materials."

<</SYS>>

How can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions? [/INST]","A number of measures governments can take to combat economic recessions are:

1. Fiscal policies: Governments can increase government spending, reduce taxes, and inject liquidity into the economy to stimulate demand and boost confidence. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the government of Greece cut interest rates, increased government spending, and increased investments in infrastructure.
2. Monetary policies: Governments can lower interest rates, provide fiscal stimulus packages, and create new sources of credit to increase demand and drive economic growth. For example, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank have all implemented unconventional monetary policies to combat the financial crisis.
3. Structural policies: Governments can implement policies to improve the business environment, invest in research and development, and reduce regulations to create a more attractive and competitive business climate. For example, the Chinese government has implemented policies to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, while the US government has implemented policies to reduce regulations and increase business-friendly tax policies.
4. Fiscal transmission policies: Governments can implement policies to transmit fiscal stimulus to other parts of the economy. For example, the US government has implemented policies to transfer funds from one part of the economy to another, such as the infrastructure bank.
5. Fiscal response policies: Governments can implement policies to respond to economic shocks by quickly addressing the root causes of economic downturns. For example, the US government has implemented policies to support the automotive industry during the financial crisis.

It is important to note that the effectiveness of these policies depends on the severity of the economic crisis and the availability of economic stimulus. In some cases, more than one policy may be effective, and a combination of policies may be needed to achieve the desired outcomes."

Do we have a moral obligation to explore space, or should we focus on solving Earth's problems first? [/INST]","Both are important, but they are different.

Human space exploration, or space colonization, is a challenging and ambitious endeavor that requires a significant amount of resources and expertise. It is not a quick fix or a substitute for solving the problems on Earth.

However, space exploration can also be a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the universe and our place in it. It can provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and the potential for life beyond Earth.

Moreover, space exploration can be a stepping stone for future human settlement of other planets. It can provide a model for how we can establish sustainable human presence on other worlds, and it can inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers who will be able to tackle the challenges of space colonization.

On the other hand, solving the problems on Earth is crucial. It requires a focus on sustainable development, poverty reduction, education, health, and justice. It requires a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances and to work together to address the interconnected issues that affect human wellbeing.

In summary, while space exploration is a valuable and important endeavor, it is not a substitute for solving the problems on Earth. We need to focus on both."

What if the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed? [/INST]","If the Maya civilization had never collapsed, it is likely that it would have continued to thrive and expand in the Americas. The Maya were a sophisticated and advanced civilization that had a complex society with a strong belief in the power of the divine. They had a complex system of writing and recorded a wide range of knowledge and history. They were also skilled in astronomy, mathematics, and architecture, and had a well-developed system of governance. It is likely that they would have continued to advance and explore their knowledge and traditions.

However, it is important to note that the Maya civilization did have periods of collapse and instability, such as the Classic Period, which lasted from 2500 BCE to 200 CE. During this time, the Maya experienced a significant decline in their power and influence, and their civilization was eventually overthrown by the Toltec and other cultures.

It is also possible that the Maya civilization collapsed for other reasons, such as environmental factors, political instability, or economic decline. However, the collapse of the Maya civilization is a complex and multifaceted issue that is still being studied and debated by historians and archaeologists today."

Can we find a formula to generate all prime numbers, and is the distribution of primes truly random? [/INST]","This is a classic problem in number theory, and the answer is no. It is not possible to generate all prime numbers using a formula.

As for the distribution of primes being random, this is a matter of some debate among mathematicians. One view is that the distribution of primes is truly random, in the sense that there is no reason to believe that any particular pattern or structure underlies the distribution of primes.

However, other mathematicians have proposed various explanations for the distribution of primes, including the Riemann Hypothesis, which is a famous conjecture in number theory. The Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on a vertical line in the complex plane."

5. Seek common ground: Look for areas of agreement, even if it's just a small start. Encourage compromise and work together to find a solution that meets everyone's needs.
6. Maintain objectivity: Avoid taking sides or getting defensive. Stay calm and focused on finding a resolution.
7. Follow through on commitments: After resolving a conflict, follow through on any commitments or actions agreed upon. This can help prevent future conflicts and rebuild trust.

Remember, conflict resolution is a process that requires time, effort, and patience. Be open to learning and growing, and work together to find a solution that works for everyone."

Why can time seem to slow down in dangerous situations? [/INST]","There are several reasons why time can seem to slow down in dangerous situations. Here are a few possible explanations:

1. Adrenaline: When we are in a dangerous situation, our bodies are flooded with adrenaline, which is a natural response to danger. This surge of energy can cause our heart rate to increase, and our senses to become more acute. As a result, time may seem to slow down, making the situation feel more intense and real.
2. Fear and anxiety: When we are in a dangerous situation, we may experience feelings of fear and anxiety. These emotions can cause our minds to race, making time seem to slow down and feel like an eternity.
3. Attention: When we are in a dangerous situation, our attention is focused on the situation at hand. This can cause time to seem to slow down as we try to process the information and figure out what to do next.

It's important to note that these feelings are normal and can occur in a variety of situations. However, if you are experiencing prolonged feelings of fear, anxiety, or time slowing down, it may be a good idea to take a step back and assess the situation. You may need to take a deep breath, seek support from friends and family, or consider seeking professional help if necessary."

how does two factor authentication work? [/INST]","Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different forms of identification or verification before accessing an account or service. This adds an extra layer of security to the traditional username and password combination, making it more difficult for hackers and unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.

There are several types of two-factor authentication, including:

1. Something you know (password or PIN) and something you have (physical token or device)
2. Something you know (password or PIN) and something you are (biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition)
3. Something you know (password or PIN) and something you have (hardware token or smart card)
4. Something you know (password or PIN) and something you are (location-based authentication)

Many websites and applications now offer 2FA as a security measure to protect user accounts and prevent unauthorized access.

In addition, 2FA can also be used to support compliance with regulations and industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."

Can a qualifying manager work remotely abroad for US employer for an year be eligible for Eb1-C while on h1-b [/INST]","An employee of an employer registered in the United States as a non-immigrant and working in a country outside of the United States may be eligible for an H1B visa under certain circumstances. The visa is issued under the H1B program, which is administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

To be eligible for an H1B visa, an employee must meet certain requirements set by USCIS. These requirements include:

1. A job offer from a U.S. employer for a specific position in the United States.
2. A valid work visa (F-1) for the same position.
3. A job offer from a U.S. employer that allows the employee to work remotely.
4. Proof of qualifications for the job.
5. Proof of ability to enter and work in the United States legally.

If an employee meets all of these requirements, they may be eligible for an H1B visa. However, it is important to note that an employee must still meet certain requirements set by their U.S. employer, such as pay scales, job duties, and performance standards.

In summary, an employee who is a qualified manager and works remotely in a country outside of the United States may be eligible for an H1B visa under certain circumstances. However, it is important to confirm the details with USCIS to ensure the visa is granted correctly."

What do the different octane values of gasoline mean? [/INST]","The different octane values of gasoline refer to the measure of a fuel's resistance to combustion and the amount of energy released during combustion. The octane value is determined by the average fuel octane number, which is a measure of the fuel's resistance to igniting an air-oxygen mixture at a specified temperature.

Here are some common values and their meanings:

* Gasoline with an octane rating of 77 is a premium-quality fuel with high energy density and low smoke. Examples include premium gasoline and 87-octane fuel.
* Gasoline with an octane rating of 82 is a fuel with moderate energy density and little smoke. Examples include standard gasoline and 82-octane fuel.
* Gasoline with an octane rating of 70 is a fuel with low energy density and moderate smoke. Examples include regular gasoline and 70-octane fuel.
* Gasoline with an octane rating of 60 is a fuel with low energy density, moderate smoke, and limited use. Examples include diesel fuel and 60-octane fuel.

It's important to note that octane ratings can vary depending on the specific brand and type of fuel, as well as the manufacturer's specifications."

In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract? [/INST]","You can create a separate presale contract that covers the details of the private sale, such as the terms and conditions of the sale, the investment amount, the allocation of tokens, and the milestones for the private sale. This way, you can clearly communicate the expectations and requirements of the private sale to potential investors.

After the private sale is complete, you can then add the tokens to the main contract, which is the contract that will govern the operation of the Defi project after the private sale. The main contract should be the more detailed and comprehensive version of the terms and conditions that will govern the entire project, including the post-sale activities, the governance structure, and the distribution of the tokens.

It is important to carefully review and finalize the main contract before signing, as it will govern the entire project and set the stage for the future success of the Defi project. The main contract should be legally binding and enforceable, so make sure to seek legal advice if necessary.

In summary, creating a separate presale contract and main contract is a good way to ensure that the private sale and main contract are legally binding and enforceable, and that the expectations and requirements of both the private sale and the main contract are clearly communicated to potential investors."

List pros and cons of lowering the capabilities of my ears by listening to loud music (70-75db) in order to withstand the incredibly loud sound of screaming kids at school. [/INST]","Lowering the capabilities of your ears by listening to loud music can have several potential benefits, including:

Pros:

* Reduced hearing damage: Listening to loud music can cause permanent hearing loss if it is done consistently over an extended period. Lowering the volume can help protect your hearing and prevent potential hearing damage.
* Improved sound quality: Lowering the volume of the music can also improve the overall sound quality, making it easier to hear the music and less distracting.
* Reduced stress: Listening to loud music can be strenuous on the ears and can be a source of stress. Lowering the volume can help reduce this stress and create a more relaxing listening experience.

Cons:

* Reduced sound quality: Lowering the volume of the music may reduce the overall sound quality, making it harder to hear the music and more distracting.
* Increased potential for hearing loss: While lowering the volume of the music can reduce the risk of hearing damage, it may also increase the risk of hearing loss if it is done consistently over an extended period.

It's important to note that the best volume for hearing protection is a consistent volume, rather than relying on individual tolerance or personal preference. It's also important to follow the recommendations of medical professionals when it comes to hearing protection."

Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python. [/INST]","Sets are a data structure in Python that stores unique elements, and they are defined by the `{}` brackets. They are often used when you want to store a collection of items that are unique, and you don't care about the order of the elements.

Lists, on the other hand, are a data structure that stores ordered elements, and they are defined by the `[]` brackets. They are often used when you want to store a collection of items that can be repeated, and you care about the order of the elements.

Here are some key differences between sets and lists in Python:

* Uniqueness: Sets are defined by the uniqueness of the elements, while lists are defined by the order of the elements.
* Order: Sets are unordered, meaning the order of the elements doesn't matter, while lists are ordered, meaning the order of the elements matters.
* Data type: Sets can store any data type, while lists can store only one data type.
* Indexing: Sets can be indexed using the `in` operator, while lists can be indexed using the `[]` brackets.
* Operations: Sets support most operations, including union, intersection, and difference, while lists support most operations, including indexing, slicing, and iteration.

Overall, the main difference between sets and lists in Python is that sets are defined by the uniqueness of the elements, while lists are defined by the order of the elements."

[/INST]","There has been quite a lot of research into this subject over the past few decades, and the answer is no, spaghetti does not actually grow on trees.

There are several theories as to why this misconception has persisted for so long, including:

* Misconceptions about the history and culture of the spaghetti plant, which is native to the Mediterranean region and has been grown and consumed for thousands of years.
* The widespread use of spaghetti in the cuisine of many cultures and the tendency to conflate this plant with other foods that are similar in appearance but not the same (e.g. a different type of pasta or a sweet or savory sauce).
* The role of marketing and food branding in the globalization of food, which has created a need for unique and exotic products.
* The tendency of people to believe and repeat information that they have heard from others, regardless of its accuracy.

In short, the misconception about spaghetti growing on trees is likely due to a combination of these factors, and is not a reflection of a deliberate attempt to deceive people."

How do I make escargot? [/INST]","To make Escargot, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Escargot:
Escargot can be installed on Ubuntu, Debian, and other Debian-based Linux distributions using the following command: `sudo apt-get install escargot`.
2. Download and install the dependencies:
Escargot has several dependencies that need to be installed before it can be used. These include:
* `libsane`: This provides a library for scanning and printing.
* `libusb`: This provides USB support for the scanner.
* `libjpeg`: This provides JPEG image format support.
* `libtiff`: This provides TIFF image format support.
* `libpoppler`: This provides PDF support.

To install these dependencies, run the following command: `sudo apt-get install libsane libusb libjpeg libtiff libpoppler`.
3. Configure Escargot:
Once Escargot is installed, you need to configure it to use your scanner. To do this, create a new file called `~/.config/escargot/escargot.conf` and add the following lines to it:
```
[escargot]
device = /dev/scanner
```
Replace `/dev/scanner` with the device name of your scanner.

For example, if your scanner is `/dev/usb/002` and `/dev/usb/003`, the `device` line should look like this:
```
[escargot]
device = /dev/usb/002 /dev/usb/003
```
4. Start Escargot:
Once Escargot is configured, you can start it by running the following command: `escargot`.

Escargot should now be running and ready to use with your scanner. You can use the `escargot-status` command to check its status.

Note: If you have multiple scanners connected to your computer, you may need to specify which scanner to use with the `--device` option. For example, to use the `/dev/usb/002` scanner, you can run the following command: `escargot --device /dev/usb/002`."

Write a symphony concert review, discussing the orchestra's performance and overall audience experience. [/INST]","Sure! Here is a sample symphony concert review:

Title: A night of symphony and passion

The orchestra performed with a passion and energy that was infectious and contagious. From the moment the lights dimmed and the music began, the audience was in for a treat. The violins soared, the cellos pulsed, and the flutes danced with each other in perfect harmony. The woodwinds added a rich, warm sound to the mix, while the brass section provided a strong, solid foundation. The percussion section was punchy and dynamic, adding depth and interest to the overall sound.

As the piece progressed, the orchestra's performance grew more complex and sophisticated. The violins' legato (meaning they played a legato with the strings rather than independently) was a thing of beauty. The counterpoint between the violins and the cellos was perfect, creating a rich, swirling sound that was both beautiful and exciting. The woodwinds and brass section also played intricate counterpoint, adding depth and texture to the music.

The soloists were also highlights of the performance. The violinist in particular had a beautiful, expressive sound that was reminiscent of a lark. The cellist's rich, warm tones were perfect for the slower movements, while the flutist's light and airy sound was perfect for the faster, more playful sections.

The orchestra's overall performance was truly remarkable. It was clear that the orchestra had put a lot of time and effort into rehearsing and preparing for this performance. The result was a truly satisfying and enjoyable experience for the audience. The musicians played with passion and energy, and the audience was drawn in by their talent.

Overall, I would highly recommend this orchestra to anyone looking for a classical music experience. The performance was truly outstanding, and the audience was in for a treat."

In this math problem, we are asked to figure out the percentage of total profits that are made in each quarter. They are 90% in the first quarter, 92% in the second quarter, 81% in the third quarter and 88% in the fourth quarter. What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters? [/INST]","To find the total profit percent over a period of time, we need to first add up the profits for each quarter to get the total profit for each period. Then, we can divide the total profit by the total period to get the profit percent.

So, for the first period, the total profit is 90%. For the second period, the total profit is 92%. For the third period, the total profit is 81%. For the fourth period, the total profit is 88%.

Adding up these values, we get a total profit of 273% over a period of time.

Now, to find the profit percent, we can divide the total profit by the total period, which is 400%.

So, the profit percent for each period is:

First quarter: 90%
Second quarter: 92%
Third quarter: 81%
Fourth quarter: 88%
Total period: 400%

Note that the profit percent is the percentage of total profit made over a period of time, so it is calculated by dividing the total profit by the total period."

How well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there? [/INST]","The book ""Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, was published in 2008. The main points discussed in the book include:

1. The Illusion of Free Will: Taleb argues that our sense of free will is an illusion, and that the decisions we make are often determined by chance rather than by our own intentions.
2. The Power of Randomness: Taleb highlights the power of randomness in shaping our lives and the world around us. He argues that randomness is the primary force driving many of the events in our lives and that we should embrace it rather than fearing it.
3. The Illusion of Control: Taleb argues that our desire for control and predictability is a result of the cognitive biases of confirmation bias and the availability heuristic.
4. The Importance of Context: Taleb emphasizes the importance of understanding the context in which our choices are made, and the role that past experiences, beliefs, and cultural background play in shaping our decisions.
5. The Dangers of Over-Reasoning: Taleb warns against over-reasoning and the dangers of attempting to predict the future. He argues that the uncertainty of the future is a necessary part of the human experience, and that we should embrace it rather than trying to control it.

The book was well received by many readers and received critical acclaim for its insight into the role of randomness and chance in our lives and the world around us. Taleb's writing is often described as thought-provoking and challenging, and his ideas have influenced many readers to rethink their attitudes towards chance and free will.

There were some negative reviews of the book, particularly from some religious scholars and conservative thinkers who found Taleb's ideas too radical and offensive. However, the book's positive impact on many readers has made it a bestseller and a widely influential work in the field of philosophy and psychology."

Implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address. [/INST]","Here's an example of a regular expression in Python that can be used to validate an email address:
```

    return re.match(email_pattern, email) is not None
```
This regular expression uses the following format:

* `^` matches the beginning of the email address
* `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches any combination of letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and plus signs
* `@` matches the literal character `@`
* `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches any combination of letters, numbers, and periods
* `\.` matches the literal character `.`
* `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches any combination of letters with at least two characters
* `$` matches the end of the email address

The `re.match()` function is used to check if the regular expression matches the input string. If it does, the function returns `None`. If it doesn't, the function returns a match object.

You can also use `re.search()` function to search for the regular expression in a string. If the function finds a match, it returns a match object. If it doesn't find a match, it returns `None`.

You can also use `re.compile()` function to compile the regular expression into a pattern. Then use the `match()` or `search()` function to match the regular expression with the input string."

    - Shorts
    - T-shirts
    - Jeans
    - Skirts
    - Dresses
  - Not washable items - This category should contain all clothing that cannot be washed, folded, ironed, or put into a washing machine. This includes:
    - Tents
    - Umbrellas
    - Scarves
    - Hats
    - Sunglasses
    - Accessories
    - Other clothing items that cannot be washed, folded, ironed, or put into a washing machine

I am making mayonnaise, it was starting to thicken but now it has become runny and liquid again, is there any way to salvage it? [/INST]","It's possible to salvage a runny mayonnaise, but it's important to act quickly. The best way to salvage a runny mayonnaise is to add a small amount of an acidic ingredient, such as vinegar or lemon juice, to the mixture. This will help to reduce the acidity and neutralize the flavor. You can then continue to add more ingredients and whisk the mixture until it thickens again.

If you don't have an acidic ingredient on hand, you can try using a vinegar-based homemade strawberry-flavored syrup as a substitute. If the mayonnaise is particularly bad, you may need to try using a different cooking method, such as baking or sautéing, to create a thicker consistency.

It's important to note that salvaging a runny mayonnaise is not always possible, as the ingredients may have reacted too far to be saved. In that case, you may need to start over with a new batch of ingredients."
