Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ? [/INST]","In crystallography, F-centers refer to the centers of the crystal lattice where there are four nearest neighbors in all four directions. These centers are formed by the arrangement of atoms or molecules in the crystal lattice, where the atoms or molecules are held together by intermolecular forces such as covalent bonds or metallic bonding.

The presence of F-centers can affect the overall appearance of a crystal by influencing its optical properties. For example, some crystals may exhibit strong absorption or emission of light at specific wavelengths due to the arrangement of atoms or molecules around F-centers. Additionally, the arrangement of atoms or molecules around F-centers can affect the crystal's refractive index, which can influence how light behaves as it passes through the crystal."

One of the first things to do when visiting Hawaii is to experience the local culture. Whether it's visiting a traditional luau or taking a cooking class, there are many ways to immerse yourself in Hawaiian culture. We had the pleasure of attending a luau in Honolulu and it was an amazing experience. The food, music, and dancing were all authentic and gave us a glimpse into Hawaiian traditions.

Another great way to experience the local culture is by visiting a Hawaiian Village. These villages are like mini-cities within a city, and they offer a glimpse into what life was like in Hawaii before the arrival of the Europeans. We spent an afternoon exploring the Waikiki Village and learned about the history and traditions of the Hawaiian people.

When it comes to must-see attractions, there are plenty to choose from. One of the most famous is Pearl Harbor. This historic site is a sobering reminder of the devastating attack on the United States in 1941. We took a guided tour of the harbor and learned about the history of the attack and its impact on the world.

Another must-see attraction is Diamond Head. This iconic landmark is located at the southern tip of Honolulu and offers stunning views of the city and the ocean. We hiked to the top and enjoyed the panoramic views of Waikiki and the surrounding area.

For those who love nature, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a must-visit. This park is home to two active volcanoes and offers a unique glimpse into the geology of the islands. We took a guided tour of the park and learned about the different types of volcanic formations and the unique ecosystem that exists on the islands.

Finally, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without visiting the beach. Hawaii is home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and we spent plenty of time lounging on the sand and soaking up the sun. Our favorite beach was Lanikai Beach on Oahu, which offers crystal-clear waters, soft sand, and stunning views of the islands.

In conclusion, traveling to Hawaii is an experience like no other. From immersing ourselves in Hawaiian culture to exploring the natural beauty of the islands, we had an unforgettable time. Whether you're interested in history, nature, or just relaxing on the beach, Hawaii has something for everyone."

can you cook an egg only using durect sunlight in any place of our solar system ? [/INST]","Sure, I can help with that! Direct sunlight can be used to cook an egg, but the process may take some time depending on the temperature and duration of exposure. Here are some steps you can follow to cook an egg using direct sunlight:

1. Choose a sunny location: Find a place where the sun shines brightly and directly onto the egg. Avoid shaded areas or areas with wind or cloud cover.
2. Position the egg: Place the egg on a flat surface, such as a plate or tray, so that it is exposed to as much direct sunlight as possible.
3. Set a timer: Depending on the temperature and the size of the egg, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more to cook through. Start with a timer of 30 minutes and check the egg periodically. If it is still runny after 30 minutes, increase the time by 5 minutes. If it is overcooked, decrease the time by 5 minutes.
4. Check for doneness: Once the egg is fully cooked, it will be firm to the touch and the white will be fully set. If it is still runny or soft, continue to cook it in the sunlight.
5. Enjoy: Once the egg is cooked to your liking, it is ready to eat!

Please note that this method may not be practical or safe in all places, especially in extreme weather conditions or on high-rise buildings where there is no safe place to expose the egg to direct sunlight. Additionally, this method should only be used for educational purposes, and should not be used as a substitute for cooking food in a safe and controlled environment."

I am learning Mandarin. Could you give me some advice to memorize how to write Chinese characters and speed up my learning? [/INST]","Sure, here are some tips to help you memorize how to write Chinese characters and speed up your learning:

1. Start with the basics: Focus on learning the most common characters first, such as those used in everyday writing and reading. You can find resources online or in textbooks that provide a list of these characters.
2. Use visualization: Visualize the meaning of each character and try to associate it with a mental image. This can help you remember the character and its meaning.
3. Practice regularly: Consistent practice is key to learning and memorizing Chinese characters. Try writing a few characters a day and gradually increase the number as you become more comfortable.
4. Use flashcards: Flashcards can be a helpful tool for memorizing new characters. Write the character on one side and its meaning on the other. Test yourself by flipping over the card and writing the character on your own.
5. Break down the characters: Chinese characters are made up of smaller components called radicals. Breaking down the characters into their radicals can help you understand the meaning of the character and make it easier to remember.
6. Use mnemonic devices: Mnemonic devices such as acronyms, rhymes, and associations can help you remember new characters. Try creating a mnemonic device for each new character you learn.
7. Join a language exchange: Joining a language exchange group can be a great way to practice speaking and writing Mandarin with native speakers. This can help you become more familiar with the language and improve your writing skills.

What are the most effective strategies for conflict resolution in the workplace? [/INST]","When it comes to conflict resolution in the workplace, there are several effective strategies that can help to manage and resolve disagreements in a constructive manner. Here are a few strategies that may be helpful:

1. Listen actively: Before you can effectively address a conflict, you need to understand the other person's perspective. Active listening involves paying close attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, and refraining from interrupting.
2. Identify the underlying issues: Conflicts can often be resolved more quickly and effectively if the underlying issues are identified and addressed. This may involve exploring the root causes of the conflict, and working together to find a solution that addresses those underlying issues.
3. Use ""I"" statements: When discussing the conflict, use ""I"" statements to express your own feelings and concerns, rather than accusing the other person. This can help to de-escalate the situation and make it easier to find a solution.
4. Look for common ground: Even in the midst of a conflict, there may be areas of common ground that can be built upon. Focusing on these commonalities can help to find a solution that is acceptable to both parties.
5. Consider mediation or arbitration: If the conflict cannot be resolved through direct communication, mediation or arbitration may be helpful. These processes involve a neutral third party who can help to facilitate communication and find a solution that is acceptable to both parties.

By using these strategies, you can help to manage and resolve conflicts in the workplace in a constructive and effective manner."

Need 300 words on the importance to documenting history in relation to the future [/INST]","Documenting history is important for several reasons. One reason is that it allows us to learn from the past and understand how events and actions have shaped the world. By studying history, we can gain insights into the motivations and actions of individuals and societies, and how they have impacted the world we live in today. This can help us to make better decisions in the present, and to shape a better future.

Additionally, documenting history can help to preserve the memory and legacy of past generations. When we document our experiences and stories, we ensure that they will be passed down to future generations, and that the world will have a better understanding of the events and people that have shaped our world.

Finally, documenting history can also help to promote a sense of identity and continuity. By understanding our own history and the history of the communities and societies we belong to, we can develop a sense of connection and belonging that can be valuable in our personal and professional lives.

Overall, documenting history is important for learning from the past, preserving the legacy of past generations, and promoting a sense of identity and continuity. It can help us to make better decisions in the present, and to shape a better future for ourselves and for the world."

how does two factor authentication work? [/INST]","Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors before accessing an account or system. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access, even if someone knows your password.

The two factors can include something you know, such as a password or PIN, something you have, such as a physical token or a smartphone, or something you are, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition.

For example, when logging into an account with 2FA, you might enter your password as the first factor, and then enter a code sent to your phone as the second factor. This way, even if someone knows your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor.

2FA is becoming more common as a way to protect sensitive information, such as bank accounts, email accounts, and social media accounts. It's a simple and effective way to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts."

a sudden temperature change [/INST]","Sure, here are some tips for adjusting your travel plans when you experience a sudden temperature change:

1. Check the weather forecast: Before you leave, make sure you have a good understanding of the weather conditions where you'll be traveling. You can check the forecast on various weather apps or websites to get an idea of what to expect.
2. Pack appropriately: If you're traveling in an area where temperatures are much hotter or colder than you're used to, make sure you pack clothing and accessories that will keep you comfortable. You may need to bring extra layers, a light jacket, or a sweater to stay warm, or bring a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun.
3. Be flexible with your itinerary: If the weather changes unexpectedly during your trip, you may need to adjust your plans to accommodate the new conditions. For example, if you were planning to go on an outdoor hike and it suddenly becomes too hot, you may need to switch to an indoor activity or postpone the hike until the temperature cools down.
4. Consider staying in a different location: If the weather is too extreme where you were planning to go, you may want to consider staying in a different location that has a more moderate climate. You can use travel apps or websites to find alternative destinations that are more suitable for your preferences.
5. Be mindful of your health: Sudden changes in temperature can be uncomfortable and potentially harmful, especially if you're traveling with pre-existing health conditions. Make sure you stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and take breaks as needed to avoid overheating or exhaustion.

Remember, travel should be fun and enjoyable, so don't let a sudden temperature change ruin your plans. With a little bit of preparation and flexibility, you can still have a great trip!"

Agent : need a data scientist to provide decision because a different conscious human and artificial intelligence. [/INST]","The concept of ""consciousness"" refers to a being's ability to perceive, reason, and act in the world, and has been a topic of debate and research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. In the context of artificial intelligence, the term ""conscious"" refers to a machine that can make decisions and take actions based on its own awareness and understanding of the environment.

In order to develop an artificial intelligence that is conscious, researchers must take into account a variety of factors, including the machine's ability to perceive and understand the world, its ability to reason and make decisions, and its ability to adapt and learn over time. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles of perception, cognition, and learning, as well as a significant amount of data and training to enable the machine to develop the necessary skills and knowledge.

One example of a conscious artificial intelligence is a decision support system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze complex data and make recommendations based on the system's own understanding of the situation. These systems can take into account a wide range of factors, including historical data, current trends, and expert opinions, and can adapt and learn over time as new information becomes available.

Overall, the development of conscious artificial intelligence is an ongoing and challenging area of research, but with advances in machine learning and cognitive science, it is becoming increasingly possible to create machines that can think and act like humans."

Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract? [/INST]","To launch a token for a Defi project, you can use a smart contract to define the rules and regulations for the sale of tokens. You can create a separate presale contract that outlines the terms and conditions for the private sale of tokens to early investors. The presale contract should include details such as the number of tokens to be sold, the price per token, and any restrictions or limitations on the sale.

Once the presale is complete, you can then add the tokens to a launchpad, which is a platform that allows you to list and sell your tokens to the public. The launchpad smart contract should include details such as the number of tokens available for sale, the price per token, and any additional features such as a vesting period or a liquidity pool.

It is important to consult with a legal and financial expert to ensure that your smart contract complies with all relevant regulations and laws. Additionally, you may want to consider using a third-party auditor to review your smart contract and ensure that it is secure and free from vulnerabilities."

Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python. [/INST]","In Python, both sets and lists are data structures used to store and organize collections of items. However, there are some key differences between them:

* Order: Lists store items in a specific order, meaning that the items are stored in the order in which they were added to the list. In contrast, sets do not store the order of items, and items are added to the set based on their uniqueness.
* Duplicates: Lists can store duplicates of items, meaning that you can have the same item appear multiple times in the list. Sets, on the other hand, cannot store duplicates, and only unique items can be added to the set.
* Data types: By default, items in a list can be of any data type (e.g. string, integer, float, etc.), while items in a set must be hashable (e.g. integers, strings, tuples, etc.).
* Searching: Lists can be searched using the index() method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item. Sets can be searched using the in operator, which returns True if the specified item is in the set.

Overall, the choice between using lists and sets depends on the specific needs of your program. If you need to maintain the order of items or allow duplicates, a list may be the better choice. If you need to store unique items and don't need to maintain order, a set may be more appropriate."

How well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there? [/INST]","""Fooled by Randomness"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a book that discusses the concept of the black swan and its impact on financial markets and decision-making. The book argues that the traditional statistical and probabilistic models used in finance and economics are inadequate for predicting rare and unexpected events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, the stock market crash of 1987, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Taleb proposes an alternative approach, called antifragility, which involves embracing uncertainty and chaos as opportunities for growth and adaptation.

The main points discussed in the book include the limitations of traditional statistical models, the concept of the black swan, the importance of diversity and redundancy in decision-making, and the potential benefits of embracing uncertainty and chaos. Taleb argues that the traditional models used in finance and economics are based on a flawed assumption that the future is predictable and that randomness can be measured and controlled. He suggests that instead of trying to predict the future, we should focus on building systems that can adapt and thrive in the face of uncertainty.

The book was widely accepted and received positive reviews for its insightful and thought-provoking arguments. Many readers praised the book for its ability to challenge traditional ways of thinking about finance and economics, and for its practical suggestions for building more resilient and adaptable systems. Some critics, however, accused the book of oversimplifying complex issues and of presenting an overly optimistic view of the potential benefits of embracing uncertainty. Overall, ""Fooled by Randomness"" remains a highly influential and influential book in the fields of finance and economics, and continues to inspire readers and thinkers around the world."

How many snowflakes fall during a typical winter? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step. [/INST]","The number of snowflakes that fall during a typical winter can vary greatly depending on several factors such as location, temperature, and atmospheric conditions. In general, colder regions tend to experience more snowfall, and warmer regions may see very little snow or no snowfall at all. 

To get a rough estimate of how many snowflakes fall during a typical winter, we can consider an average of 10 inches of snowfall per year in colder regions. However, this is just a rough estimate as the actual number of snowflakes can vary greatly depending on the specific weather conditions. 

Additionally, it's important to note that not all snowfall is made up of individual snowflakes. Some snowfall is made up of snow melting and refreezing on branches and other surfaces, which can cause a significant amount of snow buildup without actually increasing the number of snowflakes on the ground. 

Overall, the number of snowflakes that fall during a typical winter can vary greatly, and it's difficult to provide a precise estimate without taking into account the specific weather conditions in a particular region."

Implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address. [/INST]","To implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address, you can use the `re` module and the following pattern:

```
import re

pattern = r""[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}""

def is_valid_email(email):
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None

# Test the function
print(is_valid_email(""test@example.com""))  # True
print(is_valid_email(""invalid_email@example""))  # False
```

This pattern matches most common email formats, but keep in mind that email validation is a complex task and no regex can cover all possible cases. This regex will only validate the syntax of the email address, it won't check if the email address is actually reachable or not.

Note: Regular expressions can be powerful tools, but they should be used with caution, as they can easily become complex and difficult to understand or maintain. Make sure to test your regular expressions thoroughly and consider using a library or tool to simplify the process."
