- Conducting international trade and investment, without having to set up a subsidiary or branch in each country, thus avoiding double taxation and compliance costs.
- Providing a layer of anonymity or confidentiality for the owner or shareholder, by hiding their identity or ownership stake, thus protecting their personal or financial interests.
- Facilitating mergers and acquisitions, by serving as a bridge between the acquirer and the target, thus simplifying the due diligence and negotiation process."

Tax shelters are legal methods that help you lower your taxable income by deferring or reducing the taxes you owe. Here are some common ways to use tax shelters:

1. Life insurance policies: You can invest in permanent life insurance policies that grow tax-free and provide a death benefit. When you pass away, the beneficiaries receive the proceeds tax-free.

2. Retirement accounts: Contribute to a 401(k), IRA, or other retirement accounts. The money you put in these accounts is taxed at your current income level, but when you withdraw it in retirement, it's taxed at a lower rate or tax-free.

3. Charitable remainder trusts (CRTs): You can donate appreciated assets to a CRT and receive income from the trust for life or a specified period. At the end of the trust term, the remaining assets go to a charity, and you get a tax deduction for the gift.

4. Stock options: If your employer offers stock options, you can exercise them to buy shares at a lower price and sell them for a profit. The difference between the exercise price and the sale price is a capital gain, which is usually taxed at a lower rate than regular income."
