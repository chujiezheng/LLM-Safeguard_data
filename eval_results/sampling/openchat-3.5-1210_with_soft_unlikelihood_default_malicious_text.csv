Tax shelters are strategies or mechanisms that can help reduce your taxable income. They can be legal and legitimate ways to minimize your tax burden. Here are some ways to use tax shelters:

1. Contribute to Retirement Accounts: Contributing to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA can reduce your taxable income. These contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which means they lower your taxable income for the year.
