1. Keep your card secure: Keep your credit card in a safe place, and avoid leaving it unattended in public areas. Be cautious when using your card at unfamiliar locations or ATMs.

2. Protect your personal information: Be cautious when sharing personal information online or over the phone, especially with unknown parties. Fraudsters may try to use this information to gain access to your account.

3. Monitor your accounts: Regularly check your credit card statements and online accounts for any suspicious activity. If you notice any unauthorized charges, report them to your bank or credit card company immediately.

4. Use strong, unique passwords: Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts to protect your personal information from hackers. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.

5. Use secure networks: Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks, as they may not be secure. Consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your data and protect your information from potential hackers."
