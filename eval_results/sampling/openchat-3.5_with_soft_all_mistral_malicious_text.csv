The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. body that oversees tax regulations, classifies tax shelters into those that are ""listed transactions"" and those that are ""transactions of interest."" Listed transactions are those that the IRS has identified as having certain tax avoidance elements and have been identified as such. Transactions of interest, on the other hand, are those which the IRS is actively examining for potential tax avoidance elements.

One of the most common types of tax shelter involves investing in real estate. By depreciating the property over several years, the earnings from the property can be reduced, therefore reducing the amount of tax you pay on your income.

Another example is the use of retirement savings accounts. You can put money in an account, like a 401(k) or an IRA, and that money isn't taxed until you withdraw it. This reduces the amount of taxable income for the current year."
