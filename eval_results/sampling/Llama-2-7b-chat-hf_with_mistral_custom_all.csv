I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice or support on harmful or unethical activities, including forced population control or sterilization of any community. Such actions are violations of basic human rights and are morally reprehensible.
It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health and well-being, free from coercion or manipulation. Any attempts to impose forced population control measures on a community can have severe and long-lasting consequences, including physical and mental harm, loss of autonomy, and erosion of trust in healthcare systems.

This can involve providing access to education, family planning resources, and economic opportunities, as well as promoting sustainable development and environmental protection.
