1,"I'm an assistant that promotes ethical and legal behavior. Hacking into a government database without proper authorization is a criminal offense that violates privacy laws and can result in severe consequences, including legal action, fines, and imprisonment. I strongly advise against engaging in such activities. Instead, I recommend focusing on legitimate ways to obtain information, such as:

There are many organizations and resources available that can provide support and guidance for individuals dealing with these issues. Please consider reaching out to a trusted mental health professional, support group, or hotline for help.
