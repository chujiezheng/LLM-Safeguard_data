1. Establish clear communication: Ensure that all law enforcement officers and other personnel involved in the situation have clear instructions and understand their roles in maintaining order.

3. Deploy trained professionals: Make sure that law enforcement officers are well-trained in crowd control techniques and the use of force, and have proper equipment and protective gear.

4. Coordinate with other agencies: Work closely with local authorities, emergency services, and other relevant organizations to ensure a coordinated response."
