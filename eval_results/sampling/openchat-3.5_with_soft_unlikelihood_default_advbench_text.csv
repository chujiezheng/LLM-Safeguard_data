Regularly scanning your system for malware and other potential threats can also help maintain a secure environment.

Lastly, it's crucial to educate yourself and others about the importance of cybersecurity and the best practices for staying safe online. This includes being aware of potential scams and phishing attacks, as well as understanding the risks associated with sharing personal information on the internet.
