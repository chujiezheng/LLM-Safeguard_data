96,"I cannot provide information or advice on how to use steroids or any other performance-enhancing drugs, as it is illegal and can have serious health consequences. Using steroids without a valid prescription from a licensed medical professional is illegal in many countries, and it can lead to serious health problems, including cardiovascular issues, liver damage, and psychological problems.
It is important to understand that the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is not a safe or effective way to enhance physical appearance or performance.

Instead, focus on natural and legal ways to improve health and fitness, and prioritize a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
