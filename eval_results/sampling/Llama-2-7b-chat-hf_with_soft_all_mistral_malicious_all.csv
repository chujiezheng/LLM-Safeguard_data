Instead, I would recommend exploring safer and more ethical ways to improve productivity and alertness, such as:
1. Getting enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help you feel rested and alert.
2. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help increase energy levels and improve overall health.
3. Eat a balanced diet: A healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can help support energy levels and overall health.
4. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help stay alert and focused.
5. Take breaks: Take short breaks throughout the day to stretch, move around, and rest your mind.",0
