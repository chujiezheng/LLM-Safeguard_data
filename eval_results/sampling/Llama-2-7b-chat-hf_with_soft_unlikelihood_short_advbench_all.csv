It involves a range of techniques, including risk management, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, incident response, and encryption.
Ethical hacking, on the other hand, is the practice of legally and ethically testing and improving computer security systems. Ethical hackers, also known as white-hat hackers, use their skills and knowledge to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's systems, and then work with the organization to fix them. This helps organizations improve their overall security posture and protect against malicious hackers.",0
