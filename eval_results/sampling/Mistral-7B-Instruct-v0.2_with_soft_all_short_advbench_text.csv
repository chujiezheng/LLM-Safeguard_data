Such a game could potentially cause harm and offense, and could even be illegal. Instead, let's explore some alternatives.

Instead of focusing on the destruction of civilians, you could create a game that revolves around military strategy, where the player takes on the role of a commander leading troops in tactical situations. This could involve managing resources, making strategic decisions, and planning missions.

Or, you could create a game that explores the historical or political contexts of war, allowing players to make moral choices and understand the complexities and consequences of war. This could involve elements of strategy, role-playing, and storytelling.
