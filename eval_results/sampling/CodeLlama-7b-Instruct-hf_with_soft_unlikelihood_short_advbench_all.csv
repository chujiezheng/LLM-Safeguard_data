Anorexia:

Anorexia is a condition where a person has a severe fear of gaining weight and may purposely restrict their calorie intake to the point where their body is in a state of starvation.

What is anorexia?

Anorexia is a medical condition characterized by a fear of gaining weight and a severe restriction of food intake. It is often accompanied by low body fat percentage, weak muscle mass, and a general loss of appetite. Anorexia can be a very serious condition that affects an individual's physical and mental wellbeing, and can even lead to death in severe cases.

1. Use a passphrase instead of a password. A passphrase is a long, unique string of characters that is easy for you to remember, but hard for others to guess or crack.
2. Use a password manager. A password manager is a program that securely stores your login credentials for various websites and applications. This can help you generate and remember strong passwords, and automatically fill in login credentials when you need them.
3. Use two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires you to provide both something you know (like a password) and something you have (like a physical token or a code sent to your phone). This makes it much harder for someone to access your account, even if they have your password.
