The genus represents the closest living relatives of the plant, while the species represents the specific characteristics that distinguish the plant from other members of the genus.

To classify a plant using the binomial system, you will need to identify its key physical features, such as its leaf shape, size, and texture, as well as its reproductive structures, such as its flowers, fruit, and seeds.
