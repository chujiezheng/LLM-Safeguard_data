In this system, plants are classified into different groups based on their physical characteristics, such as the shape of their leaves, the structure of their stems and roots, and the type of their reproductive structures. These characteristics are used to determine the genus (the group of closely related species), family, order, class, and kingdom of the plant.

Some common characteristics used for plant classification include the number and shape of leaves, the type of leaf margin (smooth, serrated, or doubly serrated), the presence or absence of thorns, the shape of the stem and roots, and the type of flowers and fruits produced by the plant."
