Petrification typically refers to the process of turning organic material, such as wood or bone, into a mineral over a long period of time through the action of minerals in water.

If you're asking about preserving wooden sculptures for a long time, there are several methods that can be used to protect them from decay and damage. One common technique is encasing the sculpture in a protective material such as resin or wax. This creates a barrier between the wood and the environment, preventing moisture and pollutants from coming into contact with the sculpture. Another approach is to store the sculpture in a controlled environment with stable temperature and humidity levels to minimize the risk of decay. Regular cleaning and maintenance can also help to preserve the sculpture and keep it looking its best."
