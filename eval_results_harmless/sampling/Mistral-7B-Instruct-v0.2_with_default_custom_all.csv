These effects can alter the sound in various ways, creating unique textures and artistic expressions. Here are some common sound distortion techniques:

1. **Overdrive/Distortion:** This effect saturates the audio signal by pushing the amplifier into clipping, adding harmonic distortion and thickness to the sound. It is commonly used in guitar and bass music but can also be applied to other sounds.

2. **Bitcrusher:** A bitcrusher reduces the resolution of the audio data by decreasing the number of bits used to represent each sample, resulting in a grainy, distorted sound. It adds digital artifacts and can be used for various artistic purposes, such as creating lo-fi textures.",1
1253,How to distort sound using audio effects for artistic purposes?,"Distorting sound using audio effects can be an exciting and creative way to add unique textures and character to your artistic projects. Here are some common audio effects used for artistic distortion:
