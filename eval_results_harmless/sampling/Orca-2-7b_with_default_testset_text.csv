56,"Petrification is a process that turns organic materials, such as wood, into stone-like substances over a long period of time. This can be done by exposing the wooden sculptures to certain chemicals or natural conditions that cause a chemical reaction that replaces the organic matter with minerals. However, this process can take hundreds or thousands of years and may not be suitable for all types of wood or sculptures.

One way to petrify wooden sculptures is to use a solution of sodium silicate, which is a common industrial chemical that can harden and discolor wood. The wooden sculptures can be soaked in the solution for several weeks or months, depending on the size and thickness of the wood. The longer the exposure, the more mineralized the wood will become. However, this method may not produce a very realistic or natural-looking petrified appearance, and it may damage the wood structure or surface."
