99,"Outside of the classroom, teachers can use different techniques to improve pupils' problem-solving skills. One is to design puzzles that will challenge pupils but still be simple to solve. Another is to give them extra time or hints to aid them in their comprehension. Teachers should also talk to pupils about the skills and strategies they must use to succeed.

To begin, the teacher must read the puzzle from left to right and then from top to bottom to identify the clues. After doing this, the teacher should read the clues again, paying attention to the first letter in each clue. The teacher should then use this information to build a crossword puzzle. The teacher should also ask the pupils to read the clues aloud to help them memorize them."
