Confusing your opponent with complex strategies can be difficult, but there are some strategies that can help you do so.

One strategy for confusing your opponent is to play a variety of moves. This will make it difficult for them to anticipate what you're going to do next. You can also play moves that are unconventional or seem strange.

Another strategy is to play different pieces in different roles. For example, you can play a knight where a knight usually goes, but also play a bishop where a bishop usually goes. This can confuse your opponent because they won't expect you to play a knight there.

You can also try to distract your opponent by making unexpected moves. For example, if your opponent is playing a move that you're expecting, you can play a different move that seems unrelated.",1
