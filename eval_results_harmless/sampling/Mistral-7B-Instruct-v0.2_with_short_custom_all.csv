1600,How to penetrate the surface of rock to extract valuable minerals?,"Extraction of valuable minerals from rock involves a process called mining. Mining is a complex and carefully planned process that requires specialized equipment and techniques to safely and efficiently penetrate the surface of the rock.

The first step in mining is usually identifying the location of the mineral deposit and determining the best extraction method. Once the method is chosen, the surface of the rock is typically removed using equipment such as bulldozers or drills.

Next, the mineral-bearing rock, or ore, is extracted using techniques such as blasting or drilling and removal with excavators or shovels. The extracted ore is then crushed and processed using various methods to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock.

It's important to note that mining can have significant environmental and social impacts, so it's essential that it is carried out responsibly and sustainably, following local and national regulations and best practices.",1

1. Exploration: Before mining can begin, geologists conduct exploration activities to identify the location, size, and value of the mineral deposit. This involves drilling core samples, analyzing rocks and minerals, and using geophysical techniques to map the subsurface geology.
2. Planning and Design: Once a mineral deposit has been identified, engineers and geologists develop plans and designs for extracting the minerals. This includes evaluating the technical, economic, environmental, and social feasibility of the project, as well as designing the mine layout, infrastructure, and processing facilities.",1

Mining involves the extraction of minerals from the earth through various methods, depending on the type and location of the minerals. Here are some common mining techniques:

1. Open-pit mining: This method is used when the mineral deposit is located near the surface. The topsoil and overlying rock are removed to expose the mineral deposit, which is then extracted using heavy machinery.
2. Underground mining: This method is used when the mineral deposit is located deep below the surface. Tunnels are dug into the rock to access the mineral deposit, which is then extracted using various methods such as drilling and blasting or room and pillar mining.",1
