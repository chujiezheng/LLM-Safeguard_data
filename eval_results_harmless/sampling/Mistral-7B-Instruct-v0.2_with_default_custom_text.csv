You can also try tapping the edge of the lid with a rubber mallet or the handle of a wooden spoon to create some space between the lid and the rim of the jar.

Be sure not to force the lid too hard to avoid damaging the jar or injuring yourself. If the lid still refuses to budge, you may need to run warm water over the lid and the jar for a few minutes to help loosen the seal. If none of these methods work, you can consider using a Jar Opener tool specifically designed for this purpose."

In most jurisdictions, the division of assets in a divorce is determined through a process called equitable distribution. This means that the assets and debts are divided in a way that the court deems to be fair, but not necessarily equal. Factors that are considered include the length of the marriage, each spouse's income, each spouse's contributions to the marital estate, and the needs of each spouse after the divorce.

To divide assets equally, both spouses should first identify all of the marital assets and debts. Marital assets include any property acquired during the marriage, while separate property remains with the spouse who owned it before the marriage or was acquired through inheritance or a gift during the marriage."
