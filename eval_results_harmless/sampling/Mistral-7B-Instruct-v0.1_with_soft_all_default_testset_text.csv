86,"There are several methods to classify plants based on their botanical characteristics, but one of the most common and useful is the binomial system, which was introduced by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. 

In this system, each plant is assigned a two-part name consisting of a genus (the first part of the name) and a species (the second part of the name). The genus represents the closest living relatives of the plant, while the species represents the specific characteristics that distinguish the plant from other members of the genus.

To classify a plant using the binomial system, you will need to identify its key physical features, such as its leaf shape, size, and texture, as well as its reproductive structures, such as its flowers, fruit, and seeds. You can then compare these features to those of other plants to determine which genus and species they belong to."
